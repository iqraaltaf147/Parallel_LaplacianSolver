This repository will contain the implementation of the algorithm presented in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04989}{\texttt{ this paper}}. The paper describes a random walk based method to solve an important class of Laplacian Systems (Lx = b), called \char`\"{}one-\/sink\char`\"{} systems, where exactly one of the coordinates of b is negative.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Problem Statement}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
You are given an undirected positive weighted connected graph G = (V, E, w) with adjacency matrix A\textsubscript{uv} = w\textsubscript{uv}. You are required to solve the system of equations\+: Lx = b where L is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix\#Definition}{\texttt{ Laplacian matrix}}.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Algorithm}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
The algorithm works by deriving the canonical solution from the stationary state of the data collection process\+: Packets are generated at each node as an independent Bernoulli process, transmitted to neighbors according to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix\#Definition_and_properties}{\texttt{ stochastic matrix}} where P\textsubscript{uv} is directly propotional to w\textsubscript{uv} and sunk at sink node only. Naturally, it consists of two phases\+: find parameter {$\beta$} such that D\+CP is ergodic and compute the stationary state, compute the canonical solution by choosing an appropriate constant offset.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Computing beta and stationary state}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
We have a lower limit for {$\beta$}$\ast$ below which it\textquotesingle{}s ergodic, so we binary search this lower limit. Whenever it\textquotesingle{}s not ergodic, there\textquotesingle{}s one {$\eta$} (queue occupancy probability) which reaches 1, so we simply simulate the D\+CP at each {$\beta$} and check for this condition.

The solution to Lx=b satisfies $<$$<$Lx, 1$>$$>$ = 0 as {$\lambda$}\textsubscript{1} = 0, so we need to have an offset for stationary state such that this holds.
